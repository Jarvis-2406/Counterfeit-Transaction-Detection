# Counterfeit-Transaction-Detection
# AI-Powered Counterfeit Product Detection in E-Commerce

This project detects potential counterfeit product transactions using machine learning on a synthetic, realistic e-commerce dataset. It includes an end-to-end pipeline (preprocessing, modeling, evaluation, explainability) and produces interview-friendly visuals and explanations.

Run the notebook in Google Colab to reproduce the results. The pipeline trains multiple models and uses RandomForest + SHAP explainability for interpretable fraud detection.
